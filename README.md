Final Project for Per Scholas Internship, a full-stack web program made with Java (JSP/Servlets/Spring MVC), MariaDB, Javascript and HTML/CSS.


This program follows the Model - View - Controller design pattern, using Spring MVC. I'm currently in the process of revamping this program and updating all the Maven dependencies, so my hope is to have this project fully functional again soon!
